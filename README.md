This code reverses a string using Unicode characters (runes).

Here, runes[i], runes[j] = runes[j], runes[i] is a multiple assignment operation in the Go language.

The for loop will execute until i is less than j. Here i starts at 0, and j starts at the last index of the string (the number of runes in the string minus 1). On each iteration, i is incremented by 1, and j is decremented by 1.


reverse_test is a file that allows testing the string reversal code using input-output pairs.
